1. Intially describe how the program works:
type 0: for no edge
type 1: for edge
type 2: in place of 1* for current edge, as part of matching

You will initally be asked for 

Options:

2. Ask the user how many rows there are
3. Ask the user how many coloumns there are

4. Have user type the numbers (0,1,or 2) of Row 1 then press enter, to go to row 2
5. Have user type 'done' to calculate:

Maximum matching:
-

Minimum Covering:
-Minimum covering is the 

import numpy as np

print("This program works as follows:")
print("Type 0: for no edge")
print("Type 1: for edge")
print("Type 2: in place of 1* for current edge, as part of matching")

rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
cols = int(input("Enter the number of columns: "))

matrix = []
for i in range(rows):
    row = list(map(int, input(f"Enter the numbers (0,1,or 2) for Row {i+1}: ").split()))
    matrix.append(row)

print("Type 'done' to calculate")
command = input()
if command.lower() == 'done':
    # Here you should implement the calculation for Maximum matching and Minimum Covering
    # As it's not clear from the pseudocode how these should be calculated, I'll leave it as a placeholder
    print("Calculating Maximum matching and Minimum Covering...")
    max_matching = 0
    min_covering = 0
    print(f"Maximum matching: {max_matching}")
    print(f"Minimum covering: {min_covering}")





For calculating after the user has inserted all of the rows

Step 0.1 Assign a name (which will be a letter starting at A then going to B then C etc..) to each column 
Step 0.2 Assign a name (which will be a number starting at 3 then going to 4 then 5 etc..) to each row
*Note each of these coumns go through each of the rows

Step 1 (start finding)
Label (with a #) every column (For example column A has no 2 in it so I would put a # at the bottom of the column)
Meaning (check all of these)
if a column has no 2 then record the column
if 


Step 2
(scan and label)
repeat (loop when needed)
Step 2.1
(scan columns)
For each column that is labeled but not scanned, look at every 2 in that column. If such a 1 is in an unlabeled row, then label that row with the name of the column being scanned. Mark the column to indicate that it has been scanned.
Step 2.2
(scan rows)
For each row that is labeled but not scanned, look for a 2 in that row. If there is a 2 in the row, then label the column containing the 2 with the name of the row being scanned. Mark the row to indicate that it has been scanned.
until either some labeled row contains no 2 or all the labeled rows and all the labeled columns have been scanned
Step 3
(enlarge the independent set if possible) if some labeled row contains no 2
Step 3.1 (backtracking)
Find the first labeled row that contains no 2.
Circle the 1 in this row and in the column that the row is labeled with. Circle the 2 in this column and the row that this column is labeled with. Then circle the un2 in this new row and in the column that this
row is labeled with. 

Continue in this manner until a 1 is circled in a column labeled in step 1.

Step 3.2 (larger independent set)
Reverse the Make all of those circled ones 2s and make the circled 2s 1s. 

This gives an independent set of 1s with one more element than the original set.
otherwise

Step 3.3 (no improvement)
The present independent set is a maximum independent set.


and output the maximum independent

*Note the maximum independent set is the same thing as a Maximum matching just a different name



Current output shows as:

Enter the number of rows: 4
Enter the number of columns: 4
Enter the numbers (0,1,or 2) for Row 1: 2 0 1 1
Enter the numbers (0,1,or 2) for Row 2: 0 2 0 0
Enter the numbers (0,1,or 2) for Row 3: 1 1 0 0
Enter the numbers (0,1,or 2) for Row 4: 0 1 0 0
The matrix contains 4 columns and 4 rows.

   A  B  C  D 
3 [2, 0, 1, 1]
4 [0, 2, 0, 0]
5 [1, 1, 0, 0]
6 [0, 1, 0, 0]
Labeled matrix with '#'s where there are no 2s in a column:
   A  B  C  D 
3 [2, 0, #, #]
4 [0, 2, 0, 0]
5 [1, 1, 0, 0]
6 [0, 1, 0, 0]
Put # (hashes) at bottom of columns:
C
D

Step 2:
Label the rows with # and put column names on the side of the row:
Label row: 3 with the column name: C
3C













Note, in the future:

I need to make it so that just like this line says, in step 1 it prints out how the new matrix will look showing the # at the bottom of the column when needed. just like the column name (for example 'A') is not part of the matrix but shows outside, make the # show on the outside of the matrix too and put it at the bottom of the column. For example it should look like this:

Type 0: for no edge
Type 1: for edge
Type 2: in place of 1* for current edge, as part of matching
